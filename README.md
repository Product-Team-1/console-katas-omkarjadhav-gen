# ConsoleKatas (Gradle + JUnit 5, Multi-Test)

This is the starter repository for the ConsoleKatas assignment.

Each method has its own test file, so GitHub Classroom can show separate results.

## ðŸš€ Instructions for Learners
- Open `src/main/java/com/example/project/ConsoleKatas.java`.
- Each method has a `TODO`. Implement them one by one.
- Run tests locally with:

```bash
gradle test
```

## âœ… Autograding
GitHub Classroom will run:

```bash
gradle -q test
```

to check your work automatically.
